# AtlasDev Personal Site
See a live version over at [atlasdev.nl](https://atlasdev.nl).

## What is this?
This is the source code for my [personal site](https://atlasdev.nl). It's a terminal emulator called `AtlasOS` made with preact, typescript and webpack. Visit the site and run the command `help` to see what it can do!

## Can I use this for myself?
Sure, just give credits to me as stated in `LICENSE.md`. The code is not much and documentent, so it should not be hard to figure out how it works.

## How to build
Install all dependencies with `npm i`, and then build with `npm run build`. A live webpack dev server can be run with `npm start`.
